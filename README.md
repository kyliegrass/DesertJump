# DesertJump
This is a game I created for Harvard CS50, a free course provided by edX. This project is a work in progress but the ultimate idea is to have the dinosaur jump over the snake, simple and a quick game
Here is the link for the Scratch platform where the game was created via front end - no code at this moment
